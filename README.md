```

### Firebase Plan
You can also save your site on firebase hosting. This is far more recommended. For this case you can access my firebase host on https://checkbook-1300k.firebaseapp.com/ with your smartphone via a web browser. And you can try the PWA feature by saving it as a shortcut on your smartphone desktop.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
